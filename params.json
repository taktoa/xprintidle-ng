{"name":"xprintidle-ng","tagline":"A utility for checking how long the X server has been idle","body":"## What is _xprintidle-ng_?\r\n\r\n_xprintidle-ng_ is a utility that queries the X server for the user's idle time and prints it in milliseconds (or with a custom format string).\r\n\r\n## What should I use _xprintidle-ng_ for?\r\n\r\nScripts. Emacs configurations. Things like that. It's not a very ambitious tool.\r\n\r\n## Why did you make this?\r\n\r\nI saw the _xprintidle_ tool that this repository is based on and thought it was a shame that it wasn't yet overengineered in the grand GNU tradition. Also, I felt like learning how to properly organize a GNU autotools project, complete with internationalization support, texinfo documentation, etc. It seemed like a fun and easy learning experience, especially since I could easily work off of GNU Hello as an example (I mean, xprintidle was already pretty much just GNU Hello, except it displays the result of an API call rather than a constant string).\r\n","google":"UA-21783426-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
